/**
 * Describes a section in examined softwareâ€™s source code. Code sections may span multiple
 * methods and types. They are defined by the start statement in one compilation unit and
 * the end statement in another one that may or may not be the same as the first one. Code
 * sections are immutable, meaning that once created, their attribute cannot be changed.
 *
 * <p>A code section must describe a continuous part of the source code, meaning that the
 * last statement in the section will always be executed if the first one was executed,
 * given that no Exceptions occur. All statements that may potentially be executed after
 * the first statement but before the last one are considered to be within the section.
