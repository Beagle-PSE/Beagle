/**
 * Describes a section in examined software’s source code. Code sections may span multiple
 * methods and types. They are defined by a start statement in one source code file and an
 * end statement in another source code file that may or may not be the same as the first
 * one. Code sections are immutable, meaning that once created, their attributes cannot be
 * changed.
 *
 * <p>A code section must describe a continuous part of source code, meaning that the last
 * statement in the section will always be executed if the first one was executed, given
 * that no Exceptions occur. All statements that may potentially be executed after the
 * first statement but before the last one are considered to be in the section. A code
 * section is considered to have been “completely executed” if the section’s first and
 * last statement was executed. This does generally not mean that all statements in the
 * section were executed.
