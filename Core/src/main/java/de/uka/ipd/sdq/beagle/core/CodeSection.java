 * first one. Code sections are immutable, meaning that once created, their attribute
 * cannot be changed.

 * <p>It must be sure that in each run of the project under analysis the first line of
 * this code section is always executed before the last line and that the last line is
 * always executed after the first line, if the program did not crash during execution.
 * Otherwise the code section is not "valid".
