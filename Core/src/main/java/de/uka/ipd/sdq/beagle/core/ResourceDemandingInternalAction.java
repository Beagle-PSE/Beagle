/**
 * Models an internal action demanding resources of a specific type when being executed.
 *
 * <p>The internal action applies to a specific <em>resource type</em>. The resource type
 * describes both the resource that is demanded and the unit the demand’s value is
 * expressed in. To support extensibility, these types are represented as strings with no
 * inherent restrictions. However, the following Strings should be used per convention:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> {@code CPU}: cycles performed on a CPU
 *
 * <li>{@code CPU_MS}: milliseconds of computation performed on a CPU
 *
 * <li>{@code HDD_READ}: bytes read from a non-volatile storage
 *
 * <li> {@code HDD_READ_MS}: milliseconds of reading operations performed on a
 * non-volatile storage
 *
 * <li> {@code HDD_WRITE}: bytes written to a non-volatile storage
 *
 * <li> {@code HDD_WRITE_MS}: milliseconds of writing operations performed on a
 * non-volatile storage
 *
 * <li> {@code HDD}: bytes transfered to or from a non-volatile storage
 *
 * <li> {@code HDD_MS}: milliseconds of reading or writing operations performed on a
 * non-volatile storage
 *
 * </ul>
