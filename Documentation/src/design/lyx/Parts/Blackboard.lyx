\begin_layout Chapter
Beagle’s Knowledge: The Blackboard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Beagle Core uses the Blackboard as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after " Chapter 2.2"
key "buschmann1996patternoriented"

\end_inset

.
 The blackboard is the central data storage which stores all available SEFF
 elements, which SEFF elements should be measured, all measurement results
 and the final expression for each measurable SEFF element.
 It also stores individual information for each Measurement Tool, Measurement
 Result Analyser, Proposed Expression Analyser, and the Final Judge (in
 the this section: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the tools
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) because these tools are not allowed to hold status information.
 The fact that all status information is stored on the Blackboard allows
 the serialisation of an analysis as elements on the blackboard are serialisable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blackboard design also allows communication between the tools without
 dependencies between them: Each tool contributes its knowledge to the blackboar
d if it is able to do so and may use information of other tools but doesn't
 need to know about the tool which provided it.
 This allows addition and removal of tools without adapting the Beagle Core
 as well as developing them separately.
 Additionally, it is easy to compare different combinations of tools to
 analyse the software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it makes no sense to run a tool performing regression of the measurement
 results before any measurements have been made, the different kinds of
 tools have a different priority.
 Therefore the vocabulary of the blackboard is divided into different layers
 and the tools can only see some of them.
 On the bottom layer, there are the code sections and all tools can access
 them.
 On the highest level are the final expressions and only the final judge
 can access them.
 In between are the Measurement Result Analysers.
 They can access the measurement results (and the code sections).
 On top of them are the Proposed Expressions Analysers which additionally
 can access all already proposed Evaluable Expressions.

\begin_layout Standard
The tools contribute content of their highest level or the level above that:
 Measurement Tools contribute measurement results, Measurement Result Analysers
 and Proposed Expressions Analysers contribute

proposed
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Evaluable Expressions and the Final Judge the

 Evaluable Expressions, which will be added to the PCM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each kind of tool has a different priority, contrary to their access level:
 The Measurement Tools have the highest priority.
 Only when no Measurement Tool can contribute something, a Measurement Result
 Analysers is invoked and so on.
 This ensures, that the layers a tool depends on, have already been filled
 with the best, possible content.
 E.g.
 when a Proposed Expressions Analyser is invoked, all tools that could contribut
e content for it and do not depend on the Proposed Expressions Analyser's
 kind of results, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proposed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 evaluable expressions, have already done so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical Measurement Result Analysers are regression tools.
 Proposed Expressions Analyser are, fore example, a tool that takes the
 average of all available Evaluable Expressions or that builds new ones
 for an genetic programming approach.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This concept is supported by the Blackboard views: To ensure that each tool
 -- except the Final Judge -- can access only certain layers, they never
 get access to the blackboard.
 They only get a Blackboard View which provides the subset of the Blackboard's
 methods they are allowed to use.
 Each view can navigate to the blackboard and each method on the view delegates
 to the equivalent method on the blackboard.
 The outcome of this is, that each tool can only use the blackboard's method,
 it is allowed to use.

Measurable SEFF Elements

\begin_layout Standard
The blackboard distinguishes between measurable SEFF elements and SEFF elements
 in general.
 Tools access the set they need through their corresponding views.
