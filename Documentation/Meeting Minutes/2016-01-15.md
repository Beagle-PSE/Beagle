# Design Changes

 * Use Eclipse Launch Configurations instead of Wizard Pages
 * Prefix all Measurable SEFF Elements with “SEFF”

## Test reports
The documents should contain:

 * Overview of tests
 * Tests coverage of different parts
 * Reasons for lower test coverage at some parts
 * Evaluation (how good are the results?)
