# Meeting 2015-11-20

## Development Phases

#### Phase Managers
- Internal and external contact person
- Leader of presentation (Anyway, everyone else should participate in the presentation (2-3 minutes per Person))

#### Presentation
- The presentation of single phases is held within our management,
whereas the final presentation takes place with 4-5 other teams
(consultation between different chairs)



## Software Requirement Specification 

### DEADLINE 27.Nov, (officially 29.Nov.)

#### Must have and nice to have criteria
- We should try to be realistic about what can be done
- No technical requirements

#### Boundaries (example):
- Our software should not do any reversed engineering, building architecture, do measurements..

#### Product environment
- The dependencies belong in here (section interfaces)

#### Additional
- Diagrams in Latex. Vector graphics are preferred (decision of our team).



## Byte counter
- Idea to use byte counter on common trace API (unclear if this approach works better)
- Our design does not depend on the usage of byte counting
- [Michael Kumperberg's Dissertation](http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/documents/1751666)



## GitHub Interaction
- Not answering in time means someone is abstaining
- Each task should be specified in our issues (assignment) with a `TODO`-Tag



## Recommendation
- We should stick to `Beagle` as project name
- How to improve measurements: 5 minutes warming up (CPU). Repeat measurement 20-30 times.
Also think about CPU functions that should be turned off (e.g. Turbo-Boost).



## TODOs
- Synchronisation with SVN repository (Phase Managers!)
- SRS until 27.Nov.
