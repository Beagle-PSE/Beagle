# Prototypes
Projects that implement a certain functionality. Instead of trying to fit into the rest of the code or covering every corner case, prototypes serve as a proof of concept, often showing how to use a certain technique.

## Creating a Prototype
See [Beagleâ€™s online documentation](http://beagle-pse.github.io/Beagle/Creating%20a%20Project.html) for details on how to properly create and build prototypes.
