# Prototypes
Projects that implement a certain functionality. Instead of trying to fit into the rest of the code or covering every corner case, prototypes serve as a proof of concept, often showing how to use a certain technique.

## Creating a prototype
A prototype is simply a project on its own, which lives in a subfolder of this folder. It should have its own Eclipse project and stick to the [default layout structure](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#N14F8E). Any functionality that is required by a prototype but already realised in the production code should be copied from there.

## Building a prototype
Prototypes will automatically be built with the main project. They inherit a default configuration from it. However, a prototype can be configured like any gradle project. Inherited tasks can be overridden or be disabled if they do not make sense in the prototypeâ€™s context. If more complex build logic is required, a `buildSrc` subproject should be added, like its done for the main project.
