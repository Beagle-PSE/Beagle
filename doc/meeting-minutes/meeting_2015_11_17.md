# Meeting 2015-11-17

## Phase Managers

Based on personal preferences, we assign phase managers as follows:

 phase | manager
 ---|---
 planing | Joshua Gleitze 
 design | Christoph Michelbach, Ansgar Spiegler
 implementation | Michael Vogt
 quality control | Annika Berger
 presentation | Roman Langrehr


We decide to assign two managers to the design phase, as the project requires a sophisticated design and design changes during implementation will be handled by the managers, too.


## Agenda for Friday Meeting

 * presentation of phase manager disposition

more points are to be determined on GitHub.

## Project Language

Closing issue #3, we decide to write 

 > everything either on or eventually going to GitHub

in English.

## System Specification

Joshua will try to set up a basic structure for system specification (document and subtasks) until friday.

## GitHub Interaction

We decide that communication is crucial for our project's success. Therefore, everybody will try to respond to any GitHub activity (issues, pull requests, â€¦) within 24 hours.
