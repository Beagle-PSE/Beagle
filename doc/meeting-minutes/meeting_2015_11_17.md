# meeting 2015-11-17

## phase managers

Based on personal preferences, we assigned phase managers as follows:

 | planing			| Joshua Gleitze						|
 | design			| Christoph Michelbach, Ansgar Spiegler	|
 | implementation	| Michael Vogt							|
 | quality control	| Annika Berger							|
 | presentation		| Roman Langrehr						|


We decided to assign two managers to the design phase, as the project requires a sophisticated design and design changes during implementation will be handled by the mangers, too.


## agenda for friday meeting

 * presentation of phase manager disposition

more points are to be determined on GitHub.

## project language

Closing issue #3, we decide to write 

 > everything either on or eventually going to GitHub

in English.

## system specification

Joshua will try to set up a basic structure for system specification (document and suptasks).

## GitHub interaction

We decided that communication is crucial for our project's success. Therefore, everybody will try to respond to any GitHub activities (issues, pull requests, â€¦) within 24 hours.
