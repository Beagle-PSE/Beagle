### Common trace API
- The results only contain CPU measurements, HDD(?). Optional extension from our side.

- Problematic parameterization of hardware (easier: time models)


### Requirements
- The analysis of the monitoring data is more important for now (transformation into PCM format). After that we can start with parameterization.

- Our software should work independently from SoMoX (that means it should only depend on the results in a broader sense)


##TODO
- Read through the important chapters of the [component-based software architecture](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/Vorlesung_Komponentenbasierte_Software-Architektur_SS15) lecture
(Introduction, Specifying Components, Component Types, Development with Components, Development of Components)

- Read chapters 1,2,3,5 of [Klaus Krogmann's thesis](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/publications/pdfs/krogmann2010a.pdf)

- Everyone should think about whether he/she prefers a specific development phase to manage (There will be two managers needed for the implementation phase).
