 note 42 years after publication: Perhaps this paper's most remarkable 
feature is that it made it to publication with its thesis statement in 
the third-last paragraph. To save you the trouble of wading through 45 
paragraphs to find the thesis, I'll give an informal version of it to 
you now: Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly 
here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design 
whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.
 This turns out to be a principle with much broader utility than in 
software engineering, where references to it usually occur. I invite you
 to read the paper, then look around to find applications. My current 
favorite is the complex of social issues encompassing poverty in 
America: access to labor markets, housing, education, and health care. 
After reading the paper, think about how the structures of our various 
governments affect their approaches to this system.<br></p>

                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">Melvin E. Conway<br></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">Copyright 1968, F. D. Thompson Publications, Inc.<br>Reprinted by permission of<br>Datamation magazine,<br>where it appeared April, 1968.<span style="line-height: 16px; " class="style"><br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">That kind of intellectual
 activity which creates a whole from its diverse parts may be called the
 design of a system. Whether the particular activity is the creation of 
specifications for a major weapon system, the formation of a 
recommendation to meet a social challenge, or the programming of a 
computer, the general activity is largely the same.<br></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">Typically, the objective 
of a design organization is the creation and assembly of a document 
containing a coherently structured body of information. We may name this
 information the system design. It is typically produced for a sponsor 
who usually desires to carry out some activity guided by the system 
design. For example, a public official may wish to propose legislation 
to avert a recurrence of a recent disaster, so he appoints a team to 
explain the catastrophe. Or a manufacturer needs a new product and 
designates a product planning activity to specify what should be 
introduced.<br></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">The design organization 
may or may not be involved in the construction of the system it designs.
 Frequently, in public affairs, there are policies which discourage a 
group's acting upon its own recommendations, whereas, in private 
industry, quite the opposite situation often prevails.<br></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">It seems reasonable to 
suppose that the knowledge that one will have to carry out one's own 
recommendations or that this task will fall to others, probably affects 
some design choices which the individual designer is called upon to 
make. Most design activity requires continually making choices, Many of 
these choices may be more than design decisions; they may also be 
personal decisions the designer makes about his own future. As we shall 
see later, the incentives which exist in a conventional management 
environment can motivate choices which subvert the intent of the 
sponsor.[1]<br></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_6">Stages of Design<br></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">The initial stages of a 
design effort are concerned more with structuring of the design activity
 than with the system itself.[2] The full-blown design activity cannot 
proceed until certain preliminary milestones are passed. These include:<br></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li style="line-height: 19px; padding-left: 36px; text-indent: -25px; " class="full-width" value="1">
                      <p style="text-indent: -25px; " class="paragraph_style_7"><span style="font-size: 15px; " class="Bullet">1.</span><span style="width: 14px; " class="inline-block"></span>Understanding
 of the boundaries, both on the design activity and on the system to be 
designed, placed by the sponsor and by the world's realities,<br></p>
                    </li>
                    <li style="line-height: 19px; padding-left: 36px; text-indent: -25px; " class="full-width" value="2">
                      <p style="text-indent: -25px; " class="paragraph_style_7"><span style="font-size: 15px; " class="Bullet">2.</span><span style="width: 14px; " class="inline-block"></span>Achievement of a preliminary notion of the system's organization so that design task groups can be meaningfully assigned.<br></p>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">We shall see in detail 
later that the very act of organizing a design team means that certain 
design decisions have already been made, explicitly or otherwise. Given 
any design team organization, there is a class of design alternatives 
which cannot be effectively pursued by such an organization because the 
necessary communication paths do not exist. Therefore, there is no such 
thing as a design group which is both organized and unbiased.<br></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">Once the organization of 
the design team is chosen, it is possible to delegate activities to the 
subgroups of the organization. Every time a delegation is made and 
somebody's scope of inquiry is narrowed, the class of design 
alternatives which can be effectively pursued is also narrowed.<br></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">Once scopes of activity 
are defined, a coordination problem is created. Coordination among task 
groups, although it appears to lower the productivity of the individual 
in the small group, provides the only possibility that the separate task
 groups will be able to consolidate their efforts into a unified system 
design.<br></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">Thus the life cycle of a system design effort proceeds through the following general stages.<br></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li style="line-height: 18px; padding-left: 36px; text-indent: -25px; " class="full-width" value="1">

                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">It
 is possible that a given design activity will not proceed straight 
through this list. It might conceivably reorganize upon discovery of a 
new, and obviously superior, design concept; but such an appearance of 
uncertainty is unflattering, and the very act of voluntarily abandoning a
 creation is painful and expensive. Of course, from the vantage point of
 the historian, the process is continually repeating. This point of view
 has produced the observation that there's never enough time to do 
something right, but there's always enough time to do it over.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_9"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">The Designed System<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">Any system of consequence is structured from smaller </span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2">subsystems</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">
 which are interconnected. A description of a system, if it is to 
describe what goes on inside that system, must describe the system's 
connections to the outside world, and it must delineate each of the 
subsystems and how they are interconnected. Dropping down one level, we 
can say the same for each of the subsystems, viewing it as a system. 
This reduction in scope can continue until we are down to a system which
 is simple enough to be understood without further subdivision.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2">Examples</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">.
 A transcontinental public transportation system consists of buses, 
trains, airplanes, various types of right-of-way, parking lots, 
taxicabs, terminals, and so on. This is a very heterogeneous system; 
that is, the subsystems are quite diverse. Dropping down one level, an 
airplane, for example. may possess subsystems for structure, propulsion,
 power distribution, communication, and payload packaging. The 
propulsion subsystem has fuel, ignition, and starting subsystems, to 
name a few.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">It
 may be less obvious that a theory is a system in the same sense. It 
relates to the outside world of observed events where it must explain, 
or at least not contradict, them. It consists of subtheories which must 
relate to each other in the same way. For example, the investigation of 
an airplane crash attempts to produce a theory explaining a complex 
event. It can consist of subtheories describing the path of the 
aircraft, its radio communications, the manner of its damage, and its 
relationship to nearby objects at the time of the event. Each of these, 
in turn, is a story in itself which can be further broken down into 
finer detail down to the level of individual units of evidence.<br></span></p>

 Fig. 1 illustrates this view of a system as a linear graph -- a 
Tinker-Toy structure with branches (the lines) and nodes (the circles). 
Each node is a subsystem which communicates with other subsystems along 
the branches. In turn, each subsystem may contain a structure which may 
be similarly portrayed. The term</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2">interface</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">,
 which is becoming popular among systems people, refers to the 
inter-subsystem communication path or branch represented by a line in 
Fig. 1. Alternatively, the interface is the plug or flange by which the 
path coming out of one node couples to the path coming out of another 
node.<br></span></p>

 as with systems, we find that design groups can be viewed at several 
levels of complication. The Federal Government, for example. is an 
excellent example of a design organization with enough complexity to 
satisfy any system engineer. This is a particularly interesting example 
for showing the similarity of the two concepts being studied here 
because the Federal Government is both a design organization (designing 
laws, treaties, and policies) and a designed system (the Constitution 
being the principal preliminary design document).<br></span></p>

 We are now in a position to address the fundamental question of this 
article. Is there any predictable relationship between the graph 
structure of a design organization and the graph structure of the system
 it designs? The answer is: Yes, the relationship is so simple that in 
some cases it is an identity. Consider the following "proof."<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">Let
 us choose arbitrarily some system and the organization which designed 
it, and let us then choose equally arbitrarily some level of 
complication of the designed system for which we can draw a graph. (Our 
motivation for this arbitrariness is that if we succeed in demonstrating
 anything interesting, it will hold true for any design organization and
 level of complication.) Fig. 2 shows, for illustration purposes only, a
 structure to which the following statements may be related.<br></span></p>

Therefore, by generalization of this process, for </span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2">every</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">
 node of the system we have a rule for finding a corresponding node of 
the design organization. Notice that this rule is not necessarily 
one-to-one; that is, the two subsystems might have been designed by a 
single design group.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">Interestingly, we can make a similar statement about branches. Take any two nodes</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2">x</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1"> and </span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2">y</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">
 of the system. Either they are joined by a branch or they are not. 
(That is, either they communicate with each other in some way meaningful
 to the operation of the system or they do not.) If there is a branch, 
then the two (not necessarily distinct) design groups X and Y which 
designed the two nodes must have negotiated and agreed upon an interface
 specification to permit communication between the two corresponding 
nodes of the design organization. If, on the other hand, there is no 
branch between </span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2">x</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1"> and </span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2">y</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">,
 then the subsystems do not communicate with each other, there was 
nothing for the two corresponding design groups to negotiate, and 
therefore there is no branch between X and Y.[3]<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">What
 have we just shown? Roughly speaking, we have demonstrated that there 
is a very close relationship between the structure of a system and the 
structure of the organization which designed it. In the not unusual case
 where each subsystem had its own separate design group, we find that 
the structures (i.e., the linear graphs) of the design group and the 
system are identical. In the case where some group designed more than 
one subsystem we find that the structure of the design organization is a
 collapsed version of the structure of the system, with the subsystems 
having the same design group collapsing into one node representing that 
group.<br></span></p>

 Speaking as a mathematician might, we would say that there is a 
homomorphism from the linear graph of a system to the linear graph of 
its design organization.<br></span></p>

                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">It
 is an article of faith among experienced, system designers that given 
any system design, someone someday will find a better one to do the same
 job. In other words, it is misleading and incorrect to speak of the 
design for a specific job, unless this is understood in the context of 
space, time, knowledge, and technology. The humility which this belief 
should impose on system designers is the only appropriate posture for 
those who read history or consult their memories<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">The
 design progress of computer translators of programming languages such 
as F0RTRAN and COBOL is a case in point. In the middle fifties, when the
 prototypes of these languages appeared, their compilers were even more 
cumbersome objects than the giant (for then) computers which were 
required for their execution. Today, these translators are only 
historical curiosities, bearing no resemblance in design to today's 
compilers. (We should take particular note of the fact that the quantum 
jumps in compiler design progress were associated with the appearance of
 new groups of people on territory previously trampled chiefly by 
computer manufacturers -- first it was the tight little university 
research team, followed by the independent software house.)<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">If, then, it is reasonable to assume that for any system requirement there is a </span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_3">family</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">
 of system designs which will meet that requirement, we must also 
inquire whether the choice of design organization influences the process
 of selection of a system design from that family. If we believe our 
homomorphism, then we must agree that it does. To the extent that an 
organization is not completely flexible in its communication structure, 
that organization will stamp out an image of itself in every design it 
produces. The larger an organization is, the less flexibility it has and
 the more pronounced is the phenomenon.<br></span></p>

 A contract research organization had eight people who were to produce a
 COBOL and an ALGOL compiler. After some initial estimates of difficulty
 and time, five people were assigned to the COBOL job and three to the 
ALGOL job. The resulting COBOL compiler ran in five phases, the ALG0L 
compiler ran in three.<br></span></p>

 structures of large systems tend to disintegrate during development, 
qualitatively more so than with small systems. This observation is

objects devised by the mind of man. An activity called "system 
management" has sprung up partially in response to this tendency of 
systems to disintegrate. Let us examine the utility to system management

                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">Let
 us first examine the tendency to overpopulate a design effort. It is a 
natural temptation of the initial designer -- the one whose preliminary 
design concepts influence the organization of the design effort -- to 
delegate tasks when the apparent complexity of the system approaches his
 limits of comprehension. This is the turning point in the course of the
 design. Either he struggles to reduce the system to comprehensibility 
and wins, or else he loses control of it. The outcome is almost 
predictable if there is schedule pressure and a budget to be managed.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">A
 manager knows that he will be vulnerable to the charge of mismanagement
 if he misses his schedule without having applied all his resources. 
This knowledge creates a strong pressure on the initial designer who 
might prefer to wrestle with the design rather than fragment it by 
delegation, but he is made to feel that the cost of risk is too high to 
take the chance. Therefore, he is forced to delegate in order to bring 
more resources to bear.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">The
 following case illustrates another but related way in which the 
environment of the manager can be in conflict with the integrity of the 
system being designed.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">A
 manager must subcontract a crucial and difficult design task. He has a 
choice of two contractors, a small new organization which proposes an 
intuitively appealing approach for much less money than is budgeted, and
 an established but conventional outfit which is asking a more 
"realistic" fee. He knows that if the bright young organization fails to
 produce adequate results, he will be accused of mismanagement, whereas 
if the established outfit fails, it will be evidence that the problem is
 indeed a difficult one.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">What
 is the difficulty here? A large part of it relates to the kind of 
reasoning about measurement of resources which arises from conventional 
accounting theory. According to this theory, the unit of resource is the
 dollar, and all resources must be measured using units of measurement 
which are convertible to the dollar. If the resource is human effort, 
the unit of measurement is the number of hours worked by each man times 
his hourly cost, summed up for the whole working force.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">One
 fallacy behind this calculation is the property of linearity which says
 that two men working for a year or one hundred men working for a week 
(at the same hourly cost per man) are resources of equal value. Assuming
 that two men and one hundred men cannot work in the same organizational
 structure (this is intuitively evident and will be discussed below) our
 homomorphism says that they will not design similar systems; therefore 
the value of their efforts may not even be comparable. From experience 
we know that the two men, if they are well chosen and survive the 
experience, will give us a better system. Assumptions which may be 
adequate for peeling potatoes and erecting brick walls fail for 
designing systems.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">Parkinson's
 law[4] plays an important role in the overassignment of design effort. 
As long as the manager's prestige and power are tied to the size of his 
budget, he will be motivated to expand his organization. This is an 
inappropriate motive in the management of a system design activity. Once
 the organization exists, of course, it will be used. Probably the 
greatest single common factor behind many poorly designed systems now in
 existence has been the availability of a design organization in need of
 work.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">The
 second step in the disintegration of a system design -- the 
fragmentation of the design organization communication structure -- 
begins as soon as delegation has started. Elementary probability theory 
tells us that the number of possible communication paths in an 
organization is approximately half the square of the number of people in
 the organization. Even in a moderately small organization it becomes 
necessary to restrict communication in order that people can get some 
"work" done. Research which leads to techniques permitting more 
efficient communication among designers will play an extremely important
 role in the technology of system management.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">Common
 management practice places certain numerical constraints on the 
complexity of the linear graph which represents the administrative 
structure of a military-style organization. Specifically, each 
individual must have at most one superior and at most approximately 
seven subordinates. To the extent that organizational protocol restricts
 communication along lines of command, the communication structure of an
 organization will resemble its administrative structure. This is one 
reason why military-style organizations design systems which look like 
their organization charts.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_9"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">Conclusion<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">The
 basic thesis of this article is that organizations which design systems
 (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which
 are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. We 
have seen that this fact has important implications for the management 
of system design. Primarily, we have found a criterion for the 
structuring of design organizations: a design effort should be organized
 according to the need for communication.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">This
 criterion creates problems because the need to communicate at any time 
depends on the system concept in effect at that time. Because the design
 which occurs first is almost never the best possible, the prevailing 
system concept may need to change. Therefore, flexibility of 
organization is important to effective design.<br></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_1">Ways
 must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations
 lean and flexible. There is need for a philosophy of system design 
management which is not based on the assumption that adding manpower 
simply adds to productivity. The development of such a philosophy 
promises to unearth basic questions about value of resources and 
techniques of communication which will need to be answered before our 
system-building technology can proceed with confidence.<br></span></p>
